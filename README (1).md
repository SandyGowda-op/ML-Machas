## Introduction

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques to classify network traffic as either normal or malicious. The system is built using the NSL-KDD dataset, containing various types of attacks.

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze the dataset to understand the features and their importance.
- Preprocess the data to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Train various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
## Dataset

The NSL-KDD dataset consists of a collection of records of network traffic, where each record has 41 features.
You can download the dataset from the [NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd)
